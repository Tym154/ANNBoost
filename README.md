Welcome to Neural Network Library â€“ a lightweight and efficient C++ library designed for optimization and ease of use.
This library provides an intuitive API for building, training, and optimizing neural networks efficiently.

!!!Warning!!!
This library is under development, all features might not be working or are under development
Here are things that should work:
all CURE functions
cuda trainer, but only the forward propagation is working the backward propagation still runs on a single CPU thread.


Developing GPU and CPU paralelization for forward and backward propagation now...

Contributions are welcome!


For any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out!
